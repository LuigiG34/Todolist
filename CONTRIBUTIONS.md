3. Associate the proejct to SymfonyInsight
4. For each new feature or bug create an issue
5. Create a branch for each feature/issue
6. When you create a pull request wait for the 2 checks to pass :
- ```Automated tests``` : Your new code works with the current project
- ```SymfonyInsight``` : The quality of your code is good

### Respect coding conventions
1. Use ```camelCase``` for your variables, functions and parameters (PSR-1)
2. Use ```UpperCamelCase``` for your class names (PSR-1)
3. The files must have the same names as the classes (PSR-4)
4. The project should contain ```valid parameter and return typehints```
5. The routes should always have ```valid HTTP methods```
6. Your files should end with a ```valid new line character```

### Respect the SOLID principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) : ```Ensure every class has a single, well-defined responsibility```
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) : ```Write code that is open for extension but closed for modification```
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) : ```Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes```
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) : ```Create lean interfaces that are specific to client needs```
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : ```Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations```
